### How to Play
The object of Tic Tac Toe is to occupy three boxes in a row. You play on a three by three game board. The first player is known as X and the second is 0. Players alternate placing Xs and 0s on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or the board is full. X (first player) always goes first. If no one has three in a row when the board is full, the stalemate is called a cat game(Draw).

  #### Single Player

  To Play a single-player game against the computer do the next steps:
    
1. After executing the game input `1`.
2. Select the difficulty of the computer by writing `easy`, `medium` or `hard`.
3. Select the position you want to play according to the grid, rows go from `a-c` and columns `1-3`, example:
